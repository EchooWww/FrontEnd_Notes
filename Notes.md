# JavaScript

## 0. Basics

### 0.1 Variable declaration

- variables has their scopes: if you declare a variable with a function, it’s local to the function; if you declare it within a loop/ if-else statement, it’s local to the block, but using `var` would break the scope
- So we’d better use `let` or `const`

### 0.2 `this` keyword

- refer to an object when the function is called, when called from the global scope, it refers to the window object of the browser
- If the function is attached to an objet, and called by that object, `this` would be referring the object

### 0.3 Pass-by-value and pass-by-reference

- If the argument is an object, it’s stored in the heap and passed by reference

### 0.4 Object

- Object literal syntax with curly braces {}
- Constructor with new keyword

### 0.5 Data Structures

- array: indexed values []
- set: unique values []
- map: key-value pairs like object, but easier to be looped over

```jsx
const dict = new Map([
  [key1, value1],
  [key2, values],
]);
```

### 0.6 Event loop

- Enables async code runs in a separate thread pool
- `setTimeOut`: 1st argument is the function(callback enqueue in the event loop, will be called back when it’s ready to execute in main stack), 2nd argument is the delay in ms
- `async` and `await`: need to wrap code in to `try-catch` block to handle errors

### 0.7 Export

### 0.8 Arrays

- push: attach the element to the end

```jsx
const friends = ["Micheal", "Steven", "Peter"];
const newLength = friends.push("Echo"); // the push function, attach the element to the end
//push also return the new length of the array
console.log(friends); // ["Micheal", "Steven", "Peter", "Echo"]
```

- unshift: attach the element to the beginning
- pop(): remove the last element, and return the removed element

```jsx
const popped friends.pop();
console.log(popped); // "Echo"
```

- shift(): remove the first element of the array

```jsx
friends.shift();
console.log(friends); // ["Steven", "Peter"]
```

- indexOf(element): return the index of the element

```jsx
console.log(friends.indexOf("Steven")); // 0
console.log(friends.indexOf("Bob")); // -1
```

- includes(): return a boolean whether the array includes the element

### 0.9 Objects

In arrays, we cannot give the values a name, so we use object to define key-value pairs:

```jsx
// in objects, the order of key-value pairs don't matter at all
// we retrive the data based on the name (the 'key')
// object literal syntax
const echo = {
  firstName: "Echo",
  lastName: "Wang",
  age: 2037 - 1996,
  job: "student",
};
```

> Dot / Bracket notation

```jsx
console.log(echo.lastName); //the dot operator, need to specify the realnem
console.log(echo["lastName"]); // in the bracket notation, we can put any expression within the bracket
const nameKey = "Name";
console.log(echo["first" + nameKey]); // we can compute the name in the bracket

const interested = prompt("What do you want to know about Echo?");
console.log(echo[interested]);
```

> Add properties

```jsx
echo.location = 'Canada'
echo['instagram'] = 'Echowww';
console.log(echo);
console.log(`echo has ${echo.friends.length} friends, and her best friend is called ${echo.friends[0]};
```

> Object Methods

we can add functions to object as the ‘value’, aka ‘property’

```jsx
const echo = {
 calcAge: function() {
		this.age =  2037 - this.birthYear; // reference the object itself with `this` keyword
		return this.age;
	}
}
// pay attention: we can only have the function expression instead of the declaration here
// it's equal to `age = function(birthYear){return 2037 - birthYear}`
const age = echo.age;

getSummary : function(){
return (`${this.firstName} is a ${this.calcAge()} -year old ${this.job}, and she has ${this.driverLicense ? 'a': 'no'} driver liscense`)
```

### 0.10 Loops

- continue: exit this iteration and start the next immediately
- break: break the whole loop

```jsx
// this will only print strings
for (let i = 0; i < echo.length; i++) {
		if (typeof(echo[i])!=='string) continue;
		console.log(echo[i], typeof(echo[i]));
}
```

## 1. DOM and events fundamentals

### 1.1 DOM : document object model

> What is DOM?

- A structured representation of HTML documents, allows JavaScript to access HTML elements and styles to manipulate them
- Automatically generated by the browser when a web page loads, it's a tree structure
- In the tree, each node is an object representing a part of the document

  - document: the entry point into the DOM. e.g. `document.querySelector()` it refers to the whole HTML element
  -

> Methods to select elements

- `querySelector()`: select the first element that matches the selector
- `querySelectorAll()`: select all the elements that matches the selector
- `getElementById()`: select the element with the id
- `getElementsByClassName()`: select the elements with the class name, will return a HTML collection, rather than the elements themselves, so we need to speciry the index to get the element
- `textContent`: get the text content of the element
- `innerHTML`: get the HTML content of the element

**DOM is not part of JavaScript, it's part of the web API**

- It's not in the JavaScript language, but it's a part of the browser, which is also written in JavaScript, and we can use it without importing anything

> **Handling events: event listener**

- First, we need to specify where the event happens with DOM selectors, and then we need to listen to the event
- `addEventListener()`: add an event listener to the element, the first argument is the event type, the second argument is the function to be called when the event happens
- the function passed as the 2nd parameter would be called by the event listener function, so we don't need to call it ourselves
- When we pass a function as the second argument, it's called a callback function, so we **don't include the parentheses**, otherwise it would be called immediately

```js
document.querySelector(".check").addEventListener("click", () => {
  console.log("document.querySelector('.guess').value");
});
```

> Modyfing CSS styles with DOM manipulation

- `style`: the style property of the element, it's an object that contains all the CSS styles
- when we want to change the style of an element, we need to specify the property name in camelCase (instead of dash), e.g. `backgroundColor`

> Modifying CSS styles by adding/removing classes from classes list

- `classList`: the classList property of the element, it's an object that contains all the classes of the element
- Instead of changing the style directly, we can add/remove classes from the classList, and then define the style in the CSS file to aggregate the styles

> Handle key press events

- keyboard events are global events, so we don't need to select the element first, we can just use `addEventListener()` on the `document` object
- keyup: when the key is released; keydown: when the key is pressed; keypress: when the key is pressed and held. We usually use keydown
- which key is pressed? we can access the information by the `event` object, which is passed as the first argument of the callback function. `event.key` is the property that we need

> `classList.toggle()`
> A more flexible way to add/remove classes from the classList, it will add the class if it's not there, and remove the class if it's there

## 2. How JavaScript works behind the scenes

### 2.1 JavaScript Overview

- High-level: we don't have to worry about memory management
- Garbage-collected: we don't have to clean up the memory, the language will do it for us
- Interpreted or just-in-time compiled: the code is executed line by line, and the code is not compiled before execution
- Multi-paradigm: we can use different styles of programming, such as OOP, procedural programming, and functional programming, etc.
- Prototype-based object-oriented: regarding OOP, we don't have classes, we have prototypes. Except for primitive values, everything is an object in JavaScript. Objects inherit properties and methods from other objects, and we call it prototype chaining
- First-class functions: functions are treated as first-class citizens, we can pass functions into other functions, and return functions from functions
- Dynamic: we don't have to specify the data type of the variables, and we can change the type of the variables later. (Not like Java, which is static) If we want to use javaScript in a more static way, we can use TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript
- Single-threaded: only one command is executed at a time, and new commands are only executed after the previous one is finished. (Concurrency model: the JavaScript engine handles multiple tasks happening at the same time with the event loop and the callback queue)
- Non-blocking event loop: asynchronous behavior, which is very important in modern web development

### 2.2 JavaScript Engine and Runtime

- JS engine: a program that executes JavaScript code. It converts the code into machine code that the computer can understand. It's a part of the browser, e.g., V8 engine in Chrome. Every JS engines includes:
  - Call stack: where our code is executed.
  - Heap: where objects are stored in memory
- Compilation vs. Interpretation
  - Compilation: entire code is converted into machine code at once, and written to a binary file that can be executed by a computer. The code is not executed immediately, but saved and executed later. (e.g. C++) 2 steps: compilation and execution
  - Interpretation: interpreter runs through the source code and executes it line by line. No code is saved, and the code is executed immediately. (e.g. JavaScript) **Much slower** than compilation.
  - **Just-in-time (JIT) compilation [modern javascript use]**: entire code is converted into machine code at once, but the compilation happens just before execution. The code is executed immediately. (e.g. JavaScript). The combination of compilation and interpretation. No portable file is generated, but the code is executed immediately. **Much faster** than interpretation.

> Steps of Modern JavaScript engine working process:

1. Parsing: the code is parsed, and the abstract syntax tree (AST) is generated
2. Compilation: the AST is converted into machine code
3. Execution: the code is executed with a unoptimized machine code to start ASAP, but still to be optimized later
4. Optimization: the code is optimized during execution. The old code is replaced with the optimized code without stopping the execution
5. Compilation: the optimized code is recompiled...

The whole process happens in special threads, not the main thread, so it doesn't block the main thread, and we cannot access the compiled code directly.

> Runtime: where our JavaScript code is executed

1. Runtime in the browser
   Can be imagined as a big box, containing the engine, the web API (e.g., DOM, Timers, Fetch API), and the callback queue(e.g., the event handler functions. When the event happens, the callback function is put into the callback queue. When the call stack is empty, the callback function is put into the call stack to be executed)
   > Event loop: takes callback functions from the callback queue and puts them in the call stack, so that they can be executed
2. Runtime in Node.js
   Similar to the browser, but we don't have web APIs in Node.js, instead, we have C++ bindings, such as file system APIs, HTTP APIs, etc. We also have a thread pool, which is used to handle expensive tasks, such as image processing, etc.

### 2.3 Execution Contexts and the Call Stack

> Sequence:

1. When the first compilation is finished, the global execution context is created(for top-level code). There's only one global execution context in the call stack
   - Execution context: a wrapper to help manage the code that is running. It contains all necessary information for the execution of the code that is inside it.
2. Execution of functions and waiting for asynchronous tasks happen in the execution context
   - One execution context for each **function call**
3. All the execution contexts together form the call stack
   - Call stack: where execution contexts get stacked on top of each other, to keep track of where we are in the execution

> Execution context: contains 3 things

1. Variable environment: let, const, var, function declarations, and arguments object.
2. Scope chain: current variable environment and the variable environment of all the parent execution contexts
3. this keyword

_Special case_: the arrow function doesn't get its own this keyword and the arguments object. Instead, they use the this keyword and the arguments object of their parent execution context.

> Call Stack: where execution contexts get stacked on top of each other, to keep track of where we are in the execution

- The execution context on top of the call stack is the one that is currently running. When the function returns, the execution context is removed from the call stack, and the execution continues in the execution context below it.
- The global execution context is always at the bottom of the call stack.
- Javascript is one-threaded, we can only execute one piece of code at a time. The call stack is a map for the JS engine to know where it is in the execution.
- Only when we close the tab, the call stack is cleared, the global execution context is removed, and the JS engine is shut down.

### 2.4 Scope and the Scope Chain

> Concepts

- Scoping: Where do variables live?
- Lexical scoping: Javascript use lexical scoping (static scoping), which means the scope is determined at the time of the creation of the function.
- Scope: the space or environment in which a certain variable is declared. There are 3 types of scope: global scope, function scope, and block scope.
- Scope of a variable: region of our code where a certain variable can be accessed. (e.g., global scope, function scope, block scope, etc.)

> 3 types of scope

- Global scope: variables declared outside of any function or block. They are accessible everywhere in the code.
- Function/ local scope: variables declared inside a function. They are only accessible inside that function. (variables declared with var are function scoped)
- Block scope: variables declared inside a block. A block is a piece of code wrapped in curly braces. They are only accessible inside that block. （only applies to variables declared with **let and const and functions**）

> Scope chain

- current variable environment and the variable environment of all the parent execution contexts
- Variable lookup: the variables are not copied from parent scope to child scope, but the child scope has access to the variables in the parent scope. When we try to access a variable, the JS engine will look for the variable in the current scope, and if it cannot find the variable, it will look for the variable in the parent scope, and so on.
- Sibling scopes: the scopes that are on the same level of the scope chain. They don't have access to each other's variables.

> Scope chain and the call stack

- The scope chain has nothing to do with the execution context of the call stack. If a function is called(but not declared) inside another function, the function will not have access to the variables in the parent function.
  ![Alt text](image.png)
- If we declare a global variable again in a function/ block, and use that variable inside the function/ block, the variable will be shadowed. The variable in the function/ block will be used, and the global variable will not be affected.
- But if we change the value of a global variable inside a function/ block, the global variable will be changed.

### 2.5 Hoisting

Hoisting: makes some types of variables accessible/ usable in the code before they are actually declared.Behind the scenes, at the creation phase of our execution contest, the code is scanned for variable declarations, and for each variable, a new property is created in the variable environment object.

| Variable type                        | Hoisted?               | Initial value                        | Scope          |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| var                                  | yes                    | undefined                            | function scope |
| let & const                          | no                     | < unitialized > , temporal dead zone | block scope    |
| function declarstions                | no                     | -                                    | block scope    |
| function expressions/ Arrow function | depends on the keyword | -                                    | block scope    |

- Temporal dead zone: within the scope, but before the declaration. We cannot access the variable in TDZ. We'll get a reference error: cannot access before initialization. If we try to access the variable not ever declared, we'll get a 'is not defined' error.
- Accessing a variable before it is declared is a bad practice, and should be avoided.
- Hoisting var variables is actually byproduct of hoisting functions. For variables, we shouldn't use that
- One more difference for var variables: it is an attribute of the window object, so we can access it using window.variableName

> Best practices

- Declare variables at the top of each scope
- Don't use var keyword, use let and const instead
- Even for function declarations which could be hoisted, it's better to declare them at the top of the scope, before they are used.

### 2.6 The this Keyword

> Concepts of this keyword

- A special variable created for each execution context (every function). Takes the value of (points to) the "owner" of the function in which the this keyword is used.
- `this` is not static, it depends on how the function is called, and its value is only assigned when the function is **actually called**.
  - Method: this = object that is calling the method
  - Simple function call: this = undefined (in strict mode), or window object (in non-strict mode)
  - Arrow functions: this = this of surrounding function (if arrow function is declared on the global scope, this = window object)
  - Event listener: this = DOM element that the handler is attached to
- `this` is never pointing to the function itself, and it's also not pointing to the variable environment of the function.

> What if we want to call the object within a simple function call inside a method attribute?

- We can decalre a new variable and assign `this` to the variable, and then use the variable to access the object.
- The more modern way: use arrow functions, because arrow functions don't get their own `this` keyword, they use the `this` keyword of their parent scope, which is the object in this case.

### 2.7 Arguments Keyword

- We can get the arguments passed into a function using the `arguments` keyword. It is an array-like structure.
- Also, arrow functions don't get their own `arguments` keyword.

### 2.8 Primitives vs. Objects

> Concepts

- Number, string, boolean, undefined, null, symbol, bigint
- All the others are objects: arrays, functions, object literal

> Engine: call stack & heap

- Primitive values: stored in the call stack (in the execution context)
- objects: stored in the heap (in the heap section of the memory)

> How they works

- Primitive values: immutable, when we change the value, we actually create a new value in the call stack and point to it, and the old value is still there.
- Reference values: the address in the call stack pointing to memory in the heap, where the value is stored. If we assign a new variable to the object, the new variable will point to the same address in the call stack, and the value in the heap will not be copied. If we change the value of some attribute, the value in the heap will be changed, and all the variables pointing to that value will be changed.
- We can change the attribute of object declared with `const`, but we cannot change the value of the object (the address). The unchanged value is in the call stack, and the changed value is in the heap.
- What if we want to change an attribute value of the copy of the object? We can use `Object.assign()` to create a new object, and then change the value of the new object.
- The `Object.assign()` only creates a shallow copy, which means that if the object has another object as an attribute, the new object will still point to the same address in the heap as the old object.

  ```js
  const jessica = {
    firstName: "Jessica",
    lastName: "Williams",
    age: 27,
    family: ["Alice", "Bob"],
  };
  const marriedJessica = Object.assign({}, jessica);
  marriedJessica.lastName = "Davis";
  marriedJessica.family.push("Mary"); // this line will change the value of jessica.family as well
  console.log("Before marriage: ", jessica);
  console.log("After marriage: ", marriedJessica);
  // Before marriage:  {firstName: "Jessica", lastName: "Williams", age: 27, family: Array(3)}
  // After marriage:  {firstName: "Jessica", lastName: "Davis", age: 27, family: Array(3)}
  ```

- To deep-clone, we need some external libraries, such as lodash.

## 3. Data Structures, Modern Operators and Strings

### 3.1 Destructuring Arrays

A ESX feature that allows us to easily extract array elements or object properties and store them in variables.

```js
const arr = [2, 3, 4];
const [x, y, z] = arr;
console.log(x, y, z); // 2 3 4
```

If we only want to extract the first n elements, we can also use this syntax

```js
const [x, y] = arr;
console.log(x, y); // 2 3
```

If we wanna skip some elements, we can use empty commas

```js
const [x, , z] = arr;
console.log(x, z); // 2 4
```

We can also use destructuring to switch variables

```js
let [main, secondary] = restaurant.categories;
console.log(main, secondary); // Italian Vegetarian
[main, secondary] = [secondary, main];
console.log(main, secondary); // Vegetarian Italian
```

Receive return values from a function

```js
const [starter, mainCourse] = restaurant.order(2, 0);
console.log(starter, mainCourse); // Garlic Bread Pizza
```

Nested array destructuring

```js
const nested = [2, 4, [5, 6]];
const [i, , j] = nested;
console.log(i, j); // 2 [5, 6]
// destruct immediately
const [i, , [j, k]] = nested;
console.log(i, j, k); // 2 5 6
```

Set default values

```js
const [p = 1, q = 1, r = 1] = [8, 9];
console.log(p, q, r); // 8 9 1
```

### 3.2 Destructuring Objects

We destructure the objects with curly braces and the attribute names. The order doesn't matter, but the names must match: especially useful when we receive data from an API.

```js
const { name, openingHours, categories } = restaurant;
console.log(name, openingHours, categories); // Classico Italian ['Italian', 'Vegetarian', 'Organic']
```

What if we want the variable names to be different from the attribute names? We can use the colon to assign new names.

```js
const {
  name: restaurantName, // first the attribute name, our variable name after the colon
  openingHours: hours,
  categories: tags,
} = restaurant;
```

Have default values

```js
const { menu = [], starterMenu: starters = [] } = restaurant;
console.log(menu, starters); // [] ['Focaccia', 'Bruschetta', 'Garlic Bread', 'Caprese Salad']
```

Mutating variables: we need to have a pair of parentheses around the whole destructuring assignment.

```js
let a = 111;
let b = 999;
const obj = { a: 23, b: 7, c: 14 };
({ a, b } = obj);
```

Nested objects

```js
const {
  fri: { open: o, close: c },
} = openingHours;
console.log(o, c); // 11 23
```

We can also use destructuring to pass objects into functions. We don't need multiple arguments and can pass the attributes in any order.

```js
orderDelivery: function ({ starterIndex = 1, mainIndex= 0, time= '20:00', address }) {
    console.log(
      // we can access the variables directly without specifying 4 arguments
      `Order received! ${this.starterMenu[starterIndex]} and ${this.mainMenu[mainIndex]} will be delivered to ${address} at ${time}`
    );
  },


restaurant.orderDelivery({
time: "22:30",
address: "Via del Sole, 21",
mainIndex: 2,
starterIndex: 2,
});

```

### 3.3 The Spread Operator

Add elements to arrays

```js
const arr = [7, 8, 9];
const badNewArr = [1, 2, arr[0], arr[1], arr[2]];
console.log(badNewArr); // [1, 2, 7, 8, 9]
const newArr = [1, 2, ...arr];
console.log(newArr); // [1, 2, 7, 8, 9]
```

We can also use the spread operator to get the elements of the array individually

```js
console.log(...newArr); // 1 2 7 8 9
```

Add elements and create a new array: we are not manipulating the original array.
The big difference between the spread operator and destructuring is that the spread operator takes all the elements out of the array, while destructuring creates new variables.

```js
const newMenu = [...restaurant.mainMenu, "Gnocci"];
console.log(newMenu); // ['Pizza', 'Pasta', 'Risotto', 'Gnocci']
```

Copy array

```js
const mainMenuCopy = [...restaurant.mainMenu];
```

Join 2 arrays or more

```js
const menu = [...restaurant.starterMenu, ...restaurant.mainMenu];
console.log(menu); // ['Focaccia', 'Bruschetta', 'Garlic Bread', 'Caprese Salad', 'Pizza', 'Pasta', 'Risotto'] Containing elements from both arrays
```

Iterables: arrays, strings, maps, sets. Objects are **not iterable**. So we can use the spread operator with these data structures as well. We can only use the spread operator when building an array or when we pass values into a function.

```js
const str = "Jonas";
const letters = [...str, " ", "S."];
console.log(letters); // ['J', 'o', 'n', 'a', 's', ' ', 'S', '.']
console.log(...str); // J o n a s
```

We cannot use the spread operator as string literal, only **building arrays** or **passing values** into functions.

```js
console.log(`${...str} Schmedtmann`); // Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '...'
```

Pass values into functions

```js
const ingredients = [
  prompt("Let's make pasta! Ingredient 1?"),
  prompt("Ingredient 2?"),
  prompt("Ingredient 3?"),
];
console.log(ingredients); // ['garlic', 'olive oil', 'tomatoes']
restaurant.orderPasta(...ingredients);
```

Spread operator also works on objects, even though obejcts are not iterables. It's similar to destructuring, but it does not create new variables.

```js
const restaurantCopy = { ...restaurant };
```

### 3.4 Rest Pattern and Parameters

- The opposite of spread operator. It packs elements into an array. It's used in destructuring and functions.
- The main difference is where we use `...`. If we use it on the left side of the assignment operator, it's called the **rest operator**. If we use it on the right side of the assignment operator, it's called the **spread operator**.
- The rest operator must be the **last** element.
- There is at most **one** rest parameter in a function.

```js
// SPREAD, because on RIGHT side of =
const arr = [1, 2, ...[3, 4]];
console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3, 4]

// REST, because on LEFT side of =
const [a, b, ...others] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(a, b, others); // 1 2 [3, 4, 5]

// Both sides, the rest operator must be the last element
const [pizza, , risotto, ...otherFood] = [
  ...restaurant.mainMenu,
  ...restaurant.starterMenu,
];
console.log(pizza, risotto, otherFood); // Pizza Risotto ['Focaccia', 'Bruschetta', 'Garlic Bread', 'Caprese Salad']

// Objects with rest operator
const { sat, ...weekdays } = restaurant.openingHours;
console.log(weekdays);
```

- How rest operator works: grabs elements and pack them into an array.
  ```js
  // the rest operator in our argument means it will take all the arguments and pack them into an array called `numbers`
  const add = function (...numbers) {
    console.log(numbers);
  };
  add(2, 3); // [2, 3]
  add(5, 3, 7, 2); // [5, 3, 7, 2]
  add(8, 2, 5, 3, 2, 1, 4); // [8, 2, 5, 3, 2, 1, 4]
  const x = [23, 5, 7];
  add(...x); // [23, 5, 7]
  // we use rest when defining a function, and we use spread when calling a function, to make the function can either accept multiple values or an array, it's more flexible
  ```

### 3.5 Short Circuiting (&& and ||)

&& and || can be used with any data type, and they can return any data type, not only boolean. They can also short circuit the evaluation of any expression.

- They can use any data type
- They can return any data type connected by the operator (not only boolean)
- They do short-circuit evaluation

1. for || operator, if the first value is a truthy value, it will immediately return that first value, and it will not even evaluate the second operand. If the first value is a falsy value, it will immediately return the second value.
2. for && operator, if the first value is a falsy value, it will immediately return that first value, and it will not even evaluate the second operand. If the first value is a truthy value, it will immediately return the second value.

```js
// --- OR ---
// return the first truthy value or the last value if all are falsy
console.log(3 || "Jonas"); // 3
console.log("" || "Jonas"); // Jonas
console.log(true || 0); // true
console.log(undefined || null); // null
console.log(undefined || 0 || "" || "Hello" || 23 || null); // Hello
// In practical, we can use it to set default values
const guest1 = restaurant.numGuests ? restaurant.numGuests : 10;
// can be simplified as
const guest2 = restaurant.numGuests || 10;

// --- AND ---
// return the first falsy value or the last value if all are truthy
console.log(0 && "Jonas"); // 0
console.log(7 && "Jonas"); // Jonas
console.log("Hello" && 23 && null && "Jonas"); // null

// Practical example, to execute the second function only if the first function exists
if (restaurant.orderPizza) {
  restaurant.orderPizza("mushrooms", "spinach");
}
// can be simplified as
restaurant.orderPizza && restaurant.orderPizza("mushrooms", "spinach");
```

3. Nullish coalescing operator (??)
   - It's similar to ||, but nullish coalescing operator works with nullish values, but not falsy values.
   - Nullish values: only null and undefined (NOT 0 or '')

```js
restaurant.numGuests = 0;
const guestCorrect = restaurant.numGuests ?? 10;
console.log(guestCorrect); // 0
```

### 3.6 Logical assignment operators

- Logical operators can be used with assignment operators
- Logical operators can be used with any data type, and they can return any data type, not only boolean. They can also short circuit the evaluation of any expression.

```js
restaurant.numGuests = 20;
let guests = restaurant.numGuests || 10;
console.log(guests); // 10
restaurant.numGuests = 0;
// we can use logical operators with assignment operators

console.log(restaurant.numGuests); // 0
// or assignment operator: assign the right value if the left value is falsy
restaurant.numGuests ||= 10; // 10

// nullish coalescing assignment operator: assign the right value if the left value is nullish
restaurant.numGuests ??= 10; // 0, because 0 is not nullish

// and assignment operator: assign the right value if the left value is truthy
restaurant.numGuests &&= 10; // 0
```

\

### 3.7 The for-of Loop

- The for-of loop is a new loop introduced in ES6, and it's used for iterating over all iterables, such as arrays, strings, maps, and sets.
- we are able to still use break and continue statements in the for-of loop

```js
const menu = [...restaurant.starterMenu, ...restaurant.mainMenu];
// for-of loop
for (const item of menu) console.log(item);
// to get the index in the for-of loop, we can use the entries() method, it returns an array with the index and the element for iterables
for (const item of menu.entries()) console.log(item);
// we can destructure in the for-of loop
for (const [index, element] of menu.entries())
  console.log(`${index + 1}: ${element}`);
```

### 3.8 Enhanced Object Literals

- If we want to add a new property to an object with an existing object as the value, we can use the object literal syntax

```js
const openingHours = {
  thu: {
    open: 12,
    close: 22,
  },
  fri: {
    open: 11,
    close: 23,
  },
  sat: {
    open: 0, // Open 24 hours
    close: 24,
  },
};

const restaurant = {
  name: "BigWay",
  // we can just use the variable name, and it will be automatically converted to the same property name and assign the value of the variable to the property
  openingHours,
};
```

- We can also remove the semi-colon and the colon in the object literal for function attributes

```js
const restaurant = {
  // it's still the attribute of `order`, but we don't need to specify the key and the value
  order(starterIndex, mainIndex) {
    return [this.starterMenu[starterIndex], this.mainMenu[mainIndex]];
  },
};
```

- We can compute property names in the object literal

```js
const weekdays = ["mon", "tue", "wed", "thu", "fri", "sat", "sun"];
const openingHours = {
  [weekdays[3]]: {
    open: 12,
    close: 22,
  },
  [weekdays[4]]: {
    open: 11,
    close: 23,
  },
  [`day-${2 + 4}`]: {
    open: 0, // Open 24 hours
    close: 24,
  },
};
```

### 3.9 Optional Chaining (?.)

- The optional chaining operator is used to check if a certain property exists in an object. Only if it exists, then it will read the property. If it doesn't exist, it will return undefined immediately. It helps us to get rid of the errors because of the missing properties.

```js
// we can use the optional chaining operator and the nullish coalescing operator together
const open = restaurant.hours[day]?.open ?? "closed";
```

- We can use optional chaining for checking if a function exists in an object before calling it

```js
console.log(restaurant.order1?.(0, 1) ?? "Method does not exist");
```

- Optional chaining also works on arrays

```js
const users = [{ name: "Echo", email: "echoooo1996@gamil.com" }];
console.log(users[0]?.email ?? "user not found!");
```

### 3.10 Looping Objects: Object Keys, Values, and Entries

- We can get keys of an object using `Object.keys()`, and it returns an array of the keys

```js
// property keys
const properties = Object.keys(restaurant.hours);
console.log(properties);
let openStr = `we will open on ${properties.length} days: `;
for (const day of Object.keys(restaurant.hours)) openStr += day + " ";
```

- We can get values of an object using `Object.values()`, and it returns an array of the values

```js
const values = Object.values(restaurant.hours);
```

- We can also get both keys and values of an object using `Object.entries()`, and it returns an array of arrays, each array contains the key and the value of the property

```js
// entries [key-value pairs], getting array of arrays of length 2
const entries = Object.entries(restaurant.hours);
// we can destructure the array of arrays immediately in the for-of loop
for (const [day, { open, close }] of entries)
  console.log(`on ${day}, we open at ${open}, we close at ${close}`);
```

### 3.10 Sets

- A collection of unique values
- It can hold different daya types;

```js
const orderSet = new Set("Pasta", "Piza", "Pizza");
console.log(orderSet); // Set(2) {"Pasta", "Pizza"}
console.log(orderSet.size); // 2
console.log(orderSet.has("Pizza")); // true, works similar as the includes() method of arrays
orderSet.add("Garlic Bread");
orderSet.delete("Pasta");
```

- There is no index in sets, so we cannot get elements from sets using index
- We can use the for-of loop to loop over the elements in the set like any other iterable

```js
const staff = ["Waiter", "Chef", "Waiter", "<Manager", "Chef", "Waiter"];
const staffUnique = [...new Set(staff)]; // we can use the spread operator to convert the set to an array
console.log(staffUnique); // Set(3) {"Waiter", "Chef", "<Manager"}
console.log(new Set(staff).size); // 3
// we can also count the number of unique characters in a string
console.log(new Set("jonasschmedtmann").size); // 11
```

### 3.11 Maps

1. Maps: fundamentals

- A map is stored in key-value pairs, and it's similar to objects, but the keys can have any data type, and we can use any data type as the key. In objects, the keys are always **strings**.
- set() method: add new key-value pairs to the map, and it returns the map itself, so we can chain the set() method.

```js
const rest = new Map();
rest
  .set("open", 11)
  .set("close", 23)
  .set(true, "we are open")
  .set(false, "we are closed");

const time = 8;
// smart yet not so readable
console.log(rest.get(time > rest.get("open") && time < rest.get("close")));
```

- get(), delete(), and has() methods

```js
console.log(rest.get("open")); // 11
console.log(rest.get(true)); // we are open
rest.delete(false); // just specify the key
console.log(rest); // Map(3) {"open" => 11, "close" => 23, true => "we are open"}
console.log(rest.has(false)); // false
console.log(rest.size); // 3
```

- When we are using array as keys, we should use a variable to store the array instead of the array literal: because the array literal is not the same array in the heap, and it will not work as the key.

```js
const arr = [1, 2];
rest.set(arr, "test");
console.log(rest.get(arr)); // test
console.log(rest.get([1, 2])); // undefined
```

- We can also use maps on DOM elements

```js
rest.set(document.querySelector("h1"), "Heading");
```

2. Maps: iteration

- Maps has a similar structure (array of arrays) with the entries() method of objects, so we can convert an object to a map using the entries() method easily

```js
const map = new Map(Object.entries(ourObject));
```

- We can also convert a map to an array using the spread operator

```js
// we can use the map object to call the entries() method (unlike the object, we need to use Object.entries() as it's static)
console.log([...question]);
console.log([...question.entries()]);
console.log([...question.keys()]);
console.log([...question.values()]);
```

### 3.12 Which Data Structure to Use?

> Sources of data

- From the program itself: written directly in the source code
- From the UI (DOM, other events)
- From external sources: data fetched from wev APIs, data stored in files, etc.

If we want a simple list => use an array or a set
If we want key-value pairs => use an object or a map

> But how to decide whether to use an array or a set, or an object or a map?
> **Arrays and Sets**

- Use arrays when you need ordered list of values, and when you need to manipulate data
- Use sets when you need to work with unique values, and when high-performance is really important, and when you need to remove duplicates

**Objects and Maps**

- Objects: more traditional key/value store, easier to write and access values with . and [], and when we need to include functions(methods)
  - Use when you need to include functions/ methods as values
  - Use when working with JSON (can convert between objects and JSON)
- Maps: better performance, keys can have any data type, easy to iterate, easy to compute size, and when we simply need to map key to values
  - Use when you simply need to map key to values
  - Use when you need keys that are not strings

### 3.13 Work with Strings

1. slice(), indexOf(), lastIndexOf(), indices start from 0

```js
const airline = "TAP Air Portugal";
const plane = "A320";

console.log(plane[0]);
console.log(plane[1]);
console.log(plane[2]);
console.log("B737"[0]);

console.log(airline.length);
console.log("B737".length);

console.log(airline.indexOf("r")); // will give us the first index
console.log(airline.lastIndexOf("r"));
console.log(airline.indexOf("Air"));
console.log(airline.indexOf("air")); // will return -1 for it's case-sensitive

console.log(airline.slice(4)); // it's the position where the slice method starts -> slice method returns a new string
console.log(airline.slice(4, 7)); // the length is 7-4, left inclusive and right exclusive

console.log(airline.slice(0, airline.indexOf(" ")));
console.log(airline.slice(airline.lastIndexOf(" ") + 1));

console.log(airline.slice(-2)); // cuts off the last 2 characterss
console.log(airline.slice(1, -1)); // cuts off the last character, from the second to the one before the last

const checkMiddleSeat = function (seat) {
  // B and E are middle seats
  const s = seat.slice(-1);
  if (s === "B" || s === "E") console.log("You got the middle seat😢");
  else console.log("You are lucky😄");
};
checkMiddleSeat("11B");
checkMiddleSeat("14F");
```

- String is primitive type, yet When we call methods with string, JS behind the sence converts the primitive String to String objects: this process is called 'Boxing'
- After the methods being executed, the String objects will be converted back to primitive String again

2. toLowerCase(), toUpperCase(), trim(), replace()

- trim() would remove all the white spaces at the beginning and the end of the string
- trimStart() and trimEnd() are the new methods introduced in ES10, which would specificly remove the white spaces at the beginning or the end of the string

```js
// Fix capitalization in name
const passenger = "eCHo"; //Echo
const passengerLower = passenger.toLowerCase();
const passengerCorrect =
  passengerLower[0].toUpperCase() + passengerLower.slice(1);
console.log(passengerCorrect);

// Comparing emails
const email = "hello@echo.io";
const loginEmail = "  Hello@Echo.IO  \n";
const normalizedLoginEmail = loginEmail.toLowerCase().trim();
console.log(email === normalizedLoginEmail);
```

- replace() creates a new string without mutating the original string
- replace() only replaces the first match, we can use replaceAll() to replace all the matches
- We can also use regular expressions in replace() to replace all the matches

```js
const announcement =
  "All passengers come to the boarding door 23. Boarding door 23!";

// console.log(announcement.replaceAll('door', 'gate'));

console.log(announcement.replace(/door/g, "gate"));
```

3. methods returns boolean

- includes()
- startsWith()
- endsWith()

```js
const plane = "Airbus A320neo";
console.log(plane.includes("A320")); // true
console.log(plane.includes("Boeing")); // false
console.log(plane.startsWith("Air")); // true

if (plane.startsWith("Airbus") && plane.endsWith("neo")) {
  console.log("Part of the NEW Airbus family");
}
```

4. padStart(), padEnd(), and repeat()

- The first argument is the length of the new string, the second argument is the string that we want to pad

```js
const message = "Go to gate 23!";
console.log(message.padStart(25, "+").padEnd(30, "+"));
console.log("Echo".padStart(25, "+").padEnd(30, "+"));
// ++++++++++++Go to gate 23!++
// +++++++++++++++++++++Echo++
```

- We can use pad methods easily to mask credit card numbers

```js
const maskCreditCard = function (number) {
  const str = number + "";
  const last = str.slice(-4);
  return last.padStart(str.length, "*");
};

console.log(maskCreditCard(123456789)); // ******6789
```

- repeat() method

```js
const message2 = "Bad weather... All Departures Delayed... ";
console.log(message2.repeat(5));
```

### Coding Challenge #4

```js
document.body.append(document.createElement("textarea"));
document.body.append(document.createElement("button"));

document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", () => {
  const text = document.querySelector("textarea").value;
  const words = text.split("\n");
  for (let [index, word] of words.entries()) {
    word = word.trim().toLowerCase();
    word =
      word.slice(0, word.indexOf("_") + 1) +
      word.slice(word.indexOf("_") + 1, word.indexOf("_") + 2).toUpperCase() +
      word.slice(word.indexOf("_") + 2);
    word = word.replace("_", "").padEnd(20, " ") + "✅".repeat(index + 1);
    console.log(word);
  }
});
```
